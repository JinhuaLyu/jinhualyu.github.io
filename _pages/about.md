Hello everyone! I am an incoming PhD student in the [Industrial Engineering and Management Science (IEMS) Department at Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/). I earned my M.S. in Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin, specializing in Operations Research. I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jonathan F. Bard](https://sites.utexas.edu/bard/) on my master thesis. Prior to that, I completed my bachelor degree from Nankai University. 

My research interests lie in developing algorithms for optimization problems.
